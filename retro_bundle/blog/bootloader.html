          <h1>Building a Bootloader from Scratch: A Deep Dive into x86 Boot Process</h1>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/intro.png" alt="Bootloader Introduction"></div>
<p>
So you want to understand how computers actually boot? Not the handwavy "BIOS loads the OS" explanation, but the real, low-level mechanics of what happens when you hit the power button? Good
</p>
<p>
This project is a minimal but complete bootloader that takes you from the moment the CPU starts executing at power-on, through loading code from disk, setting up memory segmentation, switching processor modes, and finally running C code. It's about 100 lines of assembly and 5 lines of C .
</p>
<h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
<p>
Modern operating systems are complicated beasts. Linux is millions of lines of code. Windows is even more. But they all start the same way: with 512 bytes of code loaded by the BIOS at a specific memory address. That's it
</p>
<p>
Those 512 bytes need to:
- Set up a working environment
- Load more code from disk (because 512 bytes isn't enough for anything useful)
- Switch the CPU from 1981 compatibility mode into something resembling modern computing
- Transfer control to your actual operating system
</p>
<p>
The bootloader presented here is the smallest practical path from power-on to executing C code. It relies solely on handwritten x86 assembly interacting directly with the CPU and BIOS, deliberately avoiding any external boot infrastructure.
</p>
<h1>WHY </h1>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/2.gif" alt="Why Learn This"></div>
<p>
Most modern development never gets anywhere near this layer, and the system is usually content to keep its earliest steps politely out of sight. Still, understanding those first instructions changes how the rest of the stack makes sense.
</p>
<p>
Working at this level forces you to confront how memory behaves in physical terms. Not heap allocators and convenient abstractions, but real addresses, segmentation rules, and the structures that determine how the processor interprets space.
</p>
<p>
It also replaces the idea of a “virtual” machine with the one that actually exists.
</p>
<h2>The Boot Process: What Actually Happens</h2>
<h3>Power On</h3>
<p>
When you press the power button, here's what happens:
</p>
<p>
1. <strong>Power supply stabilizes</strong> - Takes a few milliseconds
2. <strong>CPU reset line goes high</strong> - CPU starts executing
3. <strong>CPU jumps to firmware</strong> - On x86, this is address <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code> (yes, near the top of the 32-bit address space)
4. <strong>BIOS/UEFI runs</strong> - Checks hardware, runs POST (Power-On Self Test)
5. <strong>BIOS looks for boot device</strong> - Checks floppy, hard drive, CD-ROM, USB, network, whatever boot order you set
6. <strong>BIOS reads first sector</strong> - Takes 512 bytes from sector 0 of the boot device
7. <strong>BIOS checks magic number</strong> - Last two bytes must be <code>0x55 0xAA</code> (little-endian for <code>0xAA55</code>)
8. <strong>If valid, BIOS loads it to 0x7C00</strong> - This address is hardcoded in the BIOS
9. <strong>BIOS jumps to 0x7C00</strong> - Your code is now running!
</p>
<p>
At this point, you're executing in 16-bit real mode, you have access to BIOS interrupts, and you have 512 bytes to do something useful.
</p>
<h3>Why 0x7C00?</h3>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/3.gif" alt="Why 0x7C00"></div>
<p>
This is one of those historical quirks. The original IBM PC had 32KB of RAM. The BIOS used the first section for its data structures and interrupt vectors. The boot sector needed to be high enough to not conflict with BIOS data, but low enough to leave space for the boot program to set up a stack.
</p>
<p>
Someone at IBM decided on <code>0x7C00</code> and now, 40+ years later, we're still using it. Every x86 CPU boots the same way. Backward compatibility is a hell of a drug.
</p>
<h3>Why 512 Bytes?</h3>
<p>
Because that's how big a disk sector is. Or rather, that's how big disk sectors were on floppy disks in 1981. The BIOS reads one sector, and one sector is 512 bytes. Modern drives use larger sectors (often 4KB), but they emulate 512-byte sectors for compatibility.
</p>
<p>
That <code>0xAA55</code> magic number in the last two bytes is how the BIOS knows you're actually a boot sector and not just random data that happened to be on the disk.
</p>
<h2> The Master Boot Record</h2>
<p>
Let's look at <code>master_boot_record.asm</code> line by line:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>[bits 16]
</code></pre>
<p>
This tells NASM (the assembler) to generate 16-bit code. When the CPU starts, it's in real mode, which is the 16-bit mode that the original 8086 had in 1978. Even modern 64-bit CPUs start in this mode for compatibility.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>org 0x7c00
</code></pre>
<p>
This is imp. The <code>org</code> directive tells the assembler "assume this code will be loaded at address 0x7c00". Without this, all your memory references would be wrong. If you write <code>jmp label</code>, the assembler needs to know where <code>label</code> will actually be in memory. It calculates offsets based on the <code>org</code> address.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>Kernel_offset equ 0x1000
</code></pre>
<p>
We're going to load our kernel to address <code>0x1000</code> (4KB). Why there? Because it's far enough from our bootloader (which ends at <code>0x7e00</code>) and far enough from the BIOS data area (which ends around <code>0x500</code>). There's nothing scientific about <code>0x1000</code> - it's just a nice round number in the free region.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov [BOOT_DRIVE], dl
</code></pre>
<p>
When the BIOS jumps to your code, it puts the boot drive number in the <code>dl</code> register. <code>0x00</code> for the first floppy, <code>0x80</code> for the first hard drive, etc. We save this immediately because we'll need it later to read more sectors from the same drive.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov bp, 0x900
mov sp, bp
</code></pre>
<p>
Setting up the stack. The stack grows downward, so we set the base pointer (<code>bp</code>) and stack pointer (<code>sp</code>) to <code>0x900</code>. This gives us a stack from <code>0x900</code> down to wherever the BIOS data ends (around <code>0x500</code>). That's about 1KB of stack space, which is plenty for our bootloader.
</p>
<p>
Why <code>0x900</code>? Again, it's in the free region. Below our code at <code>0x7c00</code>, above the BIOS data. Could be <code>0x800</code> or <code>0xa00</code> - doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't overlap with anything else.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>call load_kernel
call switch_2_32bit
</code></pre>
<p>
Here's where we do the actual work. First, load more code from disk. Second, switch to 32-bit mode.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>jmp $
</code></pre>
<p>
"Jump to current address" - an infinite loop. If we get here, something went wrong. This prevents the CPU from running off into random memory and executing garbage as instructions.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>%include "disk.asm"
%include "gdt.asm"
%include "switch2_32bit.asm"
</code></pre>
<p>
NASM literally copy-pastes these files here. It's not like C includes - there's no separate compilation. The assembler just reads these files and inserts their contents at this point.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>[bits 16]

load_kernel:
    mov bx, Kernel_offset
    mov dh, 2
    mov dl, [BOOT_DRIVE]
    call disk_load
    ret
</code></pre>
<p>
This sets up the parameters for <code>disk_load</code> and calls it. We want to load 2 sectors (<code>dh = 2</code>) from the boot drive to address <code>0x1000</code> (<code>bx = Kernel_offset</code>). Why 2 sectors? Because our kernel is small. If it were bigger, we'd load more.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>[bits 32]

BEGIN_32BIT:
    call Kernel_offset
    jmp $
</code></pre>
<p>
This code runs after we've switched to 32-bit mode. Note the <code>[bits 32]</code> directive - now we're generating 32-bit instructions. We call the kernel (which is now loaded at <code>0x1000</code>), and if it ever returns (it shouldn't), we loop forever.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>BOOT_DRIVE db 0
</code></pre>
<p>
Storage for the boot drive number. <code>db</code> means "define byte" - reserve one byte of space, initialized to 0.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>times 510 - ($-$$) db 0
</code></pre>
<p>
This is some assembler stuff. <code>$</code> is the current address, <code>$$</code> is the start of the section. So <code>($-$$)</code> is how many bytes we've used so far. <code>510 - ($-$$)</code> is how many bytes we have left (out of 512 total, minus 2 for the magic number). <code>times</code> repeats the following instruction that many times. So this pads with zeros until we reach byte 510.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>dw 0xaa55
</code></pre>
<p>
The magic number. <code>dw</code> means "define word" (2 bytes). This writes <code>0x55 0xaa</code> (little-endian) at bytes 510-511. The BIOS checks for this and won't boot if it's not there.
</p>
<h2>Deep Dive: Reading From Disk</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/CPU_Registers_x86#CR0">CPU Registers x86 - CR0 Documentation</a>
</p>
<p>
The <code>disk.asm</code> file uses BIOS interrupt 0x13 to read sectors from disk. Interrupts are the way you communicate with the BIOS in real mode. You set up registers with parameters, call <code>int 0x13</code>, and the BIOS does the work.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>disk_load:
    pusha
    push dx
</code></pre>
<p>
Save all registers. BIOS interrupts might clobber them, and we want to restore the state afterward. <code>pusha</code> pushes all general-purpose registers at once.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov ah, 0x02
</code></pre>
<p>
Function 0x02 of interrupt 0x13 is "read sectors". The function number goes in <code>ah</code>. Different values of <code>ah</code> do different things (0x00 resets the disk controller, 0x03 writes sectors, etc.).
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov al, dh
</code></pre>
<p>
Number of sectors to read. We put this in <code>dh</code> before calling, now move it to <code>al</code> where the BIOS expects it.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov cl, 0x02
</code></pre>
<p>
Start reading from sector 2. Sector numbers start at 1 (not 0, because of course they don't). Sector 1 is our boot sector, so sector 2 is where our kernel starts.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov ch, 0x00
mov dh, 0x00
</code></pre>
<p>
Cylinder 0, head 0. On modern drives, these don't really correspond to physical geometry anymore, but the BIOS interface still uses this CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing. For small bootloaders, we can just use cylinder 0, head 0 and increment sectors.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>int 0x13
</code></pre>
<p>
Call the BIOS. This actually reads from the disk into memory at <code>es:bx</code>. We have <code>bx</code> set to our kernel offset, and <code>es</code> defaults to 0, so we're reading to <code>0x0000:0x1000</code> which is just <code>0x1000</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>jc disk_error
</code></pre>
<p>
Jump if carry flag is set. The BIOS sets the carry flag if an error occurred. We'd jump to an error handler (which in our case is just an infinite loop).
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>pop dx
cmp al, dh
jne sector_error
</code></pre>
<p>
The BIOS returns the number of sectors actually read in <code>al</code>. We compare it to how many we expected (<code>dh</code>, which we saved on the stack). If they don't match, something went wrong.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>popa
ret
</code></pre>
<p>
Restore registers and return. If u made it here, the kernel is loaded into memory.
</p>
<h2> The Global Descriptor Table</h2>
<p>
Before we can switch to protected mode, we need to set up the GDT..
</p>
<h3>Memory Segmentation: Why?</h3>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/4.gif" alt="Memory Segmentation"></div>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">Global Descriptor Table - Wikipedia</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor">Segment Descriptor - Wikipedia</a>
</p>
<p>
In real mode, memory addresses work like this: <code>segment:offset</code>. You have a 16-bit segment register and a 16-bit offset. The actual physical address is <code>(segment << 4) + offset</code>. This lets you address 1MB of memory (20 bits) with 16-bit registers.
</p>
<p>
In protected mode, segments work differently. Instead of shifting and adding, the segment register contains an index into the GDT. Each GDT entry describes a segment: base address, limit, access rights, privilege level.
</p>
<p>
This gives you:
- <strong>Memory protection</strong> - Segments can be marked as read-only, executable, etc.
- <strong>Privilege levels</strong> - Ring 0 (kernel) vs Ring 3 (user programs)
- <strong>More address space</strong> - Base can be 32-bit, limit can be up to 4GB
</p>
<p>
For our simple bootloader, we're going to set up flat segmentation: one code segment and one data segment, both covering the entire 4GB address space. This is what modern OSes do - real segmentation is basically unused on x86-64. We set it up because the CPU requires it, then ignore it and use paging instead.
</p>
<h3>GDT Structure</h3>
<pre class="code-block"><code>gdt_start:
    dq 0x0
</code></pre>
<p>
The first entry must be null. This is a requirement. Any attempt to load a segment register with 0 will cause a fault. It's a safety feature - if you accidentally use an uninitialized segment register, you get a clear error instead of random behavior.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>gdt_code:
    dw 0xffff    ; Segment limit, bits 0-15
    dw 0x0       ; Base address, bits 0-15
    db 0x0       ; Base address, bits 16-23
    db 10011010b ; Access byte
    db 11001111b ; Flags and limit bits 16-19
    db 0x0       ; Base address, bits 24-31
</code></pre>
<p>
A GDT entry is 8 bytes. The layout is weird because of historical reasons (the original 80286 had a different format, and they extended it for 32-bit while keeping backward compatibility). Let's break down that access byte:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>10011010b
│││││││└─ Accessed bit (CPU sets this when segment is accessed)
││││││└── Readable (for code) / Writable (for data)
│││││└─── Executable (1 = code segment, 0 = data segment)
││││└──── Must be 1
│││└───── Privilege level (0-3, we use 0 for kernel)
││└────── Privilege level
300: │└─────── Present bit (must be 1)
</code></pre>
<p>
So <code>10011010b</code> means: present, privilege 0, must-be-1, executable, readable, not accessed yet.
</p>
<p>
The flags byte is split:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>11001111b
││││└┴┴┴─ Limit bits 16-19
│││└───── Available for OS use
││└────── Must be 0 (for 32-bit segments)
│└─────── Size (1 = 32-bit, 0 = 16-bit)
└──────── Granularity (1 = limit is in 4KB blocks)
</code></pre>
<p>
So <code>11001111b</code> means: granularity=1 (4KB blocks), 32-bit, limit bits are all 1. With granularity set and limit=<code>0xfffff</code>, this gives us a 4GB segment (<code>0xfffff * 4KB = 4GB</code>).
</p>
<p>
The data segment is similar, just with <code>10010010b</code> as the access byte (not executable, writable).
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>gdt_descriptor:
    dw gdt_end - gdt_start - 1
    dd gdt_start
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the GDT descriptor that we load with <code>lgdt</code>. It's 6 bytes: 2-byte size (total bytes minus 1), 4-byte address of the GDT. The CPU needs this to know where the GDT is and how big it is.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>CODE_SEG equ gdt_code - gdt_start
DATA_SEG equ gdt_data - gdt_start
</code></pre>
<p>
These calculate offsets to our segments. <code>CODE_SEG</code> is 8 (first entry after null), <code>DATA_SEG</code> is 16. These are segment selectors - when we load <code>CODE_SEG</code> into a segment register, the CPU looks at GDT entry 8.
</p>
<h2> Switching to Protected Mode</h2>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/5.gif" alt="Switching to Protected Mode"></div>
<p>
This is the climax ehe .  We're going to flip one bit in a control register, and the CPU will completely change how it operates.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>[bits 16]

switch_2_32bit:
    cli
</code></pre>
<p>
Clear interrupts. BIOS interrupts don't work in protected mode, and we haven't set up our own interrupt handlers yet. If an interrupt fires during the transition, bad things happen. So we disable them.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>lgdt [gdt_descriptor]
</code></pre>
<p>
Load the GDT. This tells the CPU "here's your new segmentation table". The CPU doesn't start using it yet - we're still in real mode - but it needs to be loaded before we switch.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov eax, cr0
or eax, 0x1
mov cr0, eax
</code></pre>
<p>
Here it is. Control register 0 has a bunch of flags. Bit 0 is PE (Protection Enable). Setting it switches the CPU to protected mode. We read CR0, set bit 0, write it back. The instant that <code>mov cr0, eax</code> executes, we're in 32-bit protected mode.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>jmp CODE_SEG:init_32bit
</code></pre>
<p>
This is a far jump. It does two things:
</p>
<p>
1. Loads <code>CS</code> (code segment) with <code>CODE_SEG</code>, making the CPU actually start using our GDT
2. Flushes the instruction pipeline
</p>
<p>
The CPU prefetches instructions. Right now the pipeline has 16-bit instructions that were fetched before we switched modes. If we kept executing, we'd be trying to execute 16-bit instructions in 32-bit mode. This causes instant crashes. The far jump clears the pipeline and forces the CPU to refetch from the new address, now interpreting everything as 32-bit code.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>[bits 32]

init_32bit:
    mov ax, DATA_SEG
    mov ds, ax
    mov ss, ax
    mov es, ax
    mov fs, ax
    mov gs, ax
</code></pre>
<p>
Load all segment registers with our data segment. In protected mode, you can't use segments that aren't in the GDT. We load them all with <code>DATA_SEG</code> so memory accesses work correctly.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>mov ebp, 0x90000
mov esp, ebp
</code></pre>
<p>
Set up a new stack. We use <code>0x90000</code> (576KB) which is well into extended memory. We need a bigger stack now because we might be doing more complex things. The old stack was in the first 1MB, which is fine but cramped.
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>call BEGIN_32BIT
</code></pre>
<p>
Jump back to the MBR, which has a <code>BEGIN_32BIT</code> label that calls our kernel. We've made it. We're running 32-bit code.
</p>
<h2>The Kernel </h2>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/kernel.png" alt="The Kernel"></div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void main() {
    char* video = (char*) 0xb8000;
    *video = 'X';
}
</code></pre>
<p>
This is possibly the simplest kernel in existence.
</p>
<p>
<code>0xb8000</code> is the start of VGA text mode video memory. In text mode (which is what the BIOS sets up), the screen is 80x25 characters. Each character takes 2 bytes: one for the ASCII code, one for the attribute (color).
</p>
<p>
By writing <code>'X'</code> to <code>0xb8000</code>, we put 'X' in the top-left corner of the screen. The default color is light gray on black, so you'll see a light gray X.
</p>
<p>
If you wanted to make it red:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>char* video = (char*) 0xb8000;
*video = 'X';
*(video + 1) = 0x04;  // Red on black
</code></pre>
<p>
The attribute byte is <code>0x04</code> for red foreground, black background. The low nibble is foreground, high nibble is background.
</p>
<p>
To write a string:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>char* video = (char*) 0xb8000;
char* message = "Hello, World!";
int i = 0;
while (message[i] != 0) {
    video[i*2] = message[i];
    video[i*2 + 1] = 0x0F;  // White on black
    i++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
No <code>printf</code>. No standard library. Just raw memory writes. That's what "freestanding" means - no hosted environment, no runtime support. Just you and the hardware.
</p>
<h2>The Memory Map: Where Everything Lives</h2>
<p>
Here's what our memory looks like after loading:
</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>0x00000 - 0x003FF   Real Mode IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) - unused in protected mode
0x00400 - 0x004FF   BIOS Data Area
0x00500 - 0x006FF   Free (can use for bootloader data)
0x00700 - 0x008FF   Free
0x00900 - 0x00900   Our bootloader stack (grows down from here)
0x007C00 - 0x007DFF Our MBR (loaded by BIOS)
0x007E00 - 0x00FFF  Free
0x01000 - 0x01FFF   Our kernel (loaded by MBR)
0x02000 - 0x7FFFF   Free (conventional memory)
0x80000 - 0x9FFFF   Extended memory (free)
0xA0000 - 0xBFFFF   Video memory
0xC0000 - 0xFFFFF   BIOS ROM
</code></pre>
<p>
The first megabyte is called conventional memory. Above that is extended memory, which requires protected mode to access. That's one reason we switch to protected mode - we want all 4GB of address space, not just 1MB.
</p>
<h2>Building This Thing</h2>
<div class="img-container"><img src="../images/posts/bootloader/build.png" alt="Building Process"></div>
<p>
The Makefile orchestrates the build:
</p>
<p>
1. <strong>Assemble the MBR</strong>: <code>nasm -f bin master_boot_record.asm -o master_boot_record.bin</code>
- <code>-f bin</code> means output raw binary (not an object file)
- This produces exactly 512 bytes
</p>
<p>
2. <strong>Compile the kernel</strong>: <code>gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -fno-pie -c kernel.c -o kernel.o</code>
- <code>-m32</code> targets 32-bit x86
- <code>-ffreestanding</code> says we're not hosted (no libc)
- <code>-fno-pie</code> disables position-independent code
- <code>-c</code> compiles but doesn't link
</p>
<p>
3. <strong>Link the kernel</strong>: <code>ld -m elf_i386 -Ttext 0x1000 --oformat binary kernel.o -o kernel.bin</code>
- <code>-Ttext 0x1000</code> means "put the code at address 0x1000"
- <code>--oformat binary</code> outputs raw binary (not ELF)
- This strips all the ELF headers - we just want machine code
</p>
<p>
4. <strong>Concatenate</strong>: <code>cat master_boot_record.bin kernel.bin > os-image.bin</code>
- This creates a disk image: 512 bytes of MBR, then kernel
- When BIOS loads sector 1, it gets the MBR
- When the MBR loads sector 2+, it gets the kernel
</p>
<p>
The final <code>os-image.bin</code> is what you'd write to a USB drive or floppy disk to make a bootable device. QEMU can boot from it directly.
</p>
<h2>Running and Testing</h2>
<pre class="code-block"><code>make run
</code></pre>
<p>
This fires up QEMU with your image. You should see a black screen with a single 'X' in the top-left corner. That's your operating system.
</p>
<h2>A Note on Modern Systems</h2>
<p>
Everything in this document assumes legacy BIOS boot. Modern systems use UEFI, which is completely different:
</p>
<p>
- No 16-bit real mode
- PE32+ executables instead of raw binary
- FAT filesystem required
- Boot services API instead of BIOS interrupts
- Secure Boot signature verification
</p>
<p>
UEFI is technically superior - better architecture, more features, no 40-year-old cruft. But it's also more complex and less educational. Legacy BIOS boot teaches you what's actually happening at the CPU level. UEFI hides that behind abstraction layers.
</p>
<p>
Most computers still support "Legacy Boot" or "CSM" (Compatibility Support Module) mode. Enable that in BIOS settings if you want to test this bootloader on real hardware.
</p>
<p>
For learning, start with BIOS. Understand the fundamentals. Then tackle UEFI when you know what problems it's solving.
</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
You've written code that runs on bare metal, with no OS underneath. You've talked directly to the CPU, set up memory segmentation, switched processor modes. This is as low-level as programming gets (well, except for writing microcode or designing CPUs, but that's a different kind of low-level).
</p>
